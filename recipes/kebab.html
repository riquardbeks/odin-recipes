    <h1>Pakistani Chapli Kebab</h1>
    <img src="../img/image.webp" alt="Image of a Pakistani Chapli Kebab">
    <p>Chapli kebab is a minced meat patty widely popular in Pakistan. </p>
    <p>Mixed with a blend of spices, 
        ground beef is flattened into patties and shallow-fried until the exterior is charred and flavorful.</p>
    <p>Serve in a bun with pickled red onions or with a side of pita bread. 
        My raita (yogurt dip) recipe makes a great addition.</p>
